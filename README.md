# Space-Invaders

Space Invaders is a classic, fixed shooter, arcade game. The user controls a spaceship that can only move horizontally across the bottom of the screen. The spaceship is mounted with a laser cannon that the user is able to control with the aim to destroy the aliens (enemies). The player-controlled spaceship starts off protected behind bunkers that are placed horizontally across the screen. The enemy aliens also have the ability to shoot lasers downwards as they also move horiztonally and downwards. The bunkers will absorb the aliens lasers so long as it remains active.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- GNU based machines already come pre-installed with Make. For Windows users, [Make can be found here.](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) 
- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
- SNES Controller (can be purchased on Amazon, Ebay, etc)
